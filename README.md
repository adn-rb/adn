[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kishyr/ADNRuby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kishyr/ADNRuby)

A Ruby library for App.net by [@kishyr](https://alpha.app.net/kishyr). 

This library follows the current [App.net API Spec](https://github.com/appdotnet/api-spec) (as at 26 August 2012).  

### Contributors

ADN is brought to you by these very handsome gentlemen:

* Kishyr Ramdial ([@kishyr](https://alpha.app.net/kishyr))
* Dave Goodchild ([@buddhamagnet](https://alpha.app.net/buddhamagnet))
* Peter Hellberg ([@peterhellberg](https://alpha.app.net/peterhellberg))

### Installation

Simply add ADN to your Gemfile:

`gem "adn"`

Or you can install ADN directly from rubygems.org:

`gem install adn`

### Usage
For API calls that accept parameters described in the App.net API Spec, simply pass them as a dictionary to the method.  

```ruby
  require 'adn'

  ADN.token = "your App.net OAuth-token here."

  # TODO: Actually describe the usage of the library
  #       (Should be refactored first)
```

Complete documentation will be available soon, but in the meantime you can browse all API methods in `lib/adnruby.rb`.

### Changelog

* **Version 0.3.1** (28 August 2012)  
  * Fixed naming conflict
* **Version 0.3** (28 August 2012)  
  * Now includes a Post class that describes each post along with a bunch of new methods of accessing a post's replies and the post's original post.  
  * Users methods that return user details (follow, unfollow, following, followers, mute, unmute, mute_list) will now return either a User object back, or an array of User objects.  
  * Similarly, User methods that return post details (posts, mentions, stream) will return a Post object, or an array of Post objects.  
  * To accomplish all this, I've had to change the module structure which will break existing code if you've relied on the modules to access any data. Basically, all modules begin with ADN::API:: now (eg. ADN::API::Post, ADN::API::User).  
* **Version 0.2** (27 August 2012)  
  * Changed all existing classes to modules and introduced the User class for easily accessing user details
* **Version 0.1** (26 August 2012)  
  * Really basic functionality for all existing App.new API methods as per the spec.
